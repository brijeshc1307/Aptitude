##  **Trains – Formulas and Shortcut Tricks (Aptitude)**

---

###  **Basic Concepts**

* **Speed** = Distance / Time
* **Distance** = Speed × Time
* **Time** = Distance / Speed

>  Always convert speed from **km/hr to m/s** and vice versa:

* 1 km/hr = $\frac{5}{18}$ m/s
* 1 m/s = $\frac{18}{5}$ km/hr

###  **1. Time Taken by Train to Cross an Object**

| Situation                                                       | Formula                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Train crosses a **pole/tree/signal post**                       | $\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length of train}}{\text{Speed}}$                      |
| Train crosses a **platform/bridge**                             | $\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length of train + Length of platform}}{\text{Speed}}$ |
| Train crosses a **man walking** (same or opposite direction)    | Use relative speed                                                               |
| Two **trains crossing each other** (same or opposite direction) | Use relative speed, total length = sum of both trains                            |

---

###  **2. Relative Speed**

| Direction          | Relative Speed Formula                                    |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Same Direction     | $\text{Relative Speed} = \text{Faster} - \text{Slower}$   |
| Opposite Direction | $\text{Relative Speed} = \text{Speed}_1 + \text{Speed}_2$ |

>  *Use same units for both speeds (usually m/s)*

---

###  **3. Two Trains Crossing Each Other**

* If lengths are **L₁** and **L₂**, speeds are **S₁** and **S₂**:

**Time taken to cross each other**

* Same direction:
  $\text{Time} = \frac{L₁ + L₂}{S₁ - S₂}$
* Opposite direction:
  $\text{Time} = \frac{L₁ + L₂}{S₁ + S₂}$

---

###  **4. Train Passing a Man (or moving object)**

* If train of length **L** and speed **S₁**, man walking at speed **S₂**:

**Time =**

* Same direction: $\frac{L}{S₁ - S₂}$
* Opposite direction: $\frac{L}{S₁ + S₂}$

---

###  **5. Train Passing a Man Running with Speed**

> Use the same concept as above (moving object = man)

---

###  **6. Two Trains Starting at Same Time**

* Let speeds = **S₁** and **S₂**, lengths = **L₁** and **L₂**

**They will cross each other in**

* $\frac{L₁ + L₂}{S₁ + S₂}$ (if moving opposite)
* $\frac{L₁ + L₂}{|S₁ - S₂|}$ (if moving same direction)

---

###  **7. Trains Overtaking**

If train overtakes a man or another train, use:

* **Time = Distance / Relative Speed**

> Distance = length of the overtaking train (or sum if both have length)

---

### ⏱ **8. If Time Difference is Given**

If a train crosses a platform and a pole in t₁ and t₂ seconds respectively, then:

```
Length of platform = Speed × (t₁ - t₂)
```

---

###  **9. If Speed and Time Difference is Given**

If a train passes two objects at different times (or two trains take different times to cover same object), then:

**Use proportionality:**

* More speed → less time
* Apply ratio:
  $\text{S}_1/\text{S}_2 = \text{T}_2/\text{T}_1$

---

##  **Shortcut Tricks**

1. **Convert km/hr to m/s before using formulas**
   Multiply km/hr × 5/18

2. **If a train takes ‘t’ seconds to cross a pole, and length is ‘L’ meters:**

   * Speed = L / t m/s

3. **Train takes t₁ and t₂ seconds to cross pole and platform:**

   * Length of platform = Speed × (t₂ – t₁)

4. **Train takes t seconds to cross another train in opposite direction:**

   * Use relative speed = S₁ + S₂
   * Time = (L₁ + L₂) / (S₁ + S₂)

###  **Example Question**

**Q.** A train 120 m long crosses a pole in 6 seconds. Find its speed in km/hr.
**A.**
Speed = 120 / 6 = 20 m/s = 20 × (18/5) = **72 km/hr**

---
---

### **1. A train 150 m long crosses a pole in 15 seconds. Find its speed.**

**A.** Speed = Distance / Time = 150 / 15 = **10 m/s = 36 km/hr**

---

### **2. A train 180 m long crosses a platform 120 m long in 18 seconds. Find the speed.**

**A.** Total distance = 180 + 120 = 300 m
Speed = 300 / 18 = **16.67 m/s = 60 km/hr**

---

### **3. A 300 m train crosses a man walking at 3 km/hr in opposite direction in 24 seconds. Find train speed.**

**A.**
Relative speed = D / T = 300 / 24 = 12.5 m/s = 45 km/hr
So train speed = 45 + 3 = **48 km/hr**

---

### **4. A 100 m train crosses another 120 m train in 10 sec (same direction). Speed of 1st = 54 km/hr. Find speed of 2nd train.**

**A.**
54 km/hr = 15 m/s
Total length = 220 m
Relative speed = 220 / 10 = 22 m/s
Speed of 2nd = 15 – 22 = **–7 m/s (not possible)** → So they are in **opposite direction**
→ Speed = 22 – 15 = **7 m/s = 25.2 km/hr**

---

### **5. A train crosses a 250 m platform in 20 s, and a man in 10 s. Find train length.**

**A.**
Let train length = L
L / 10 = (L + 250) / 20 → Cross-multiply
20L = 10L + 2500 → 10L = 2500 → L = **250 m**

---

### **6. A train running at 72 km/hr crosses a pole. Time? (Train length = 180 m)**

**A.**
Speed = 72 × 5/18 = 20 m/s
Time = 180 / 20 = **9 sec**

---

### **7. Two trains of 150 m and 120 m move in opposite directions at 50 and 60 km/hr. Time to cross each other?**

**A.**
Total length = 270 m
Relative speed = 50+60 = 110 km/hr = 110×5/18 = 30.56 m/s
Time = 270 / 30.56 ≈ **8.83 sec**

---

### **8. A train crosses a bridge of 500 m in 25 seconds at 108 km/hr. Find length of train.**

**A.**
Speed = 108 × 5/18 = 30 m/s
Total distance = 25 × 30 = 750 m
Length of train = 750 – 500 = **250 m**

---

### **9. Two trains, each 100 m long, cross each other in 8 seconds. Speeds: 45 km/hr and ?**

**A.**
Total length = 200 m
Let speed of 2nd train = x km/hr
Relative speed = (x + 45) × 5/18
→ 200 / 8 = (x + 45) × 5/18
25 = (x + 45) × 5/18 → x + 45 = 90 → x = **45 km/hr**

---

### **10. A train running at 90 km/hr takes 10 seconds to cross a man. Length of train?**

**A.**
Speed = 90 × 5/18 = 25 m/s
Length = 25 × 10 = **250 m**

---

### **11. Train crosses a platform in 30 sec and pole in 15 sec. Length of platform = ?**

**A.**
Speed = L / 15
(L + platform) / 30 = L / 15 → Solve → Platform = **L**

---

### **12. A train of length 350 m crosses a bridge in 35 sec at 54 km/hr. Find bridge length.**

**A.**
Speed = 54 × 5/18 = 15 m/s
Distance = 35 × 15 = 525 m
Bridge = 525 – 350 = **175 m**

---

### **13. Train 1: 100 m at 60 km/hr; Train 2: 150 m at 90 km/hr. Time to cross in same direction?**

**A.**
Relative speed = 90 – 60 = 30 km/hr = 8.33 m/s
Total length = 250 m → Time = 250 / 8.33 ≈ **30 sec**

---

### **14. A train of 120 m length crosses a man walking at 6 km/hr in same direction in 12 sec. Find speed of train.**

**A.**
Let train speed = x
Relative speed = (x – 6) × 5/18 = 120 / 12 → 10 m/s
(x – 6) × 5/18 = 10 → x = **42 km/hr**

---

### **15. A train at 60 km/hr crosses a pole. Time = 18 sec. Find train length.**

**A.**
Speed = 60 × 5/18 = 16.67 m/s → Length = 16.67 × 18 = **300 m**

---

### **16. A train of unknown length crosses a 200 m platform in 24 sec at 15 m/s. Length of train?**

**A.**
Distance = 24 × 15 = 360
Train = 360 – 200 = **160 m**

---

### **17. Two trains cross each other in 10 sec (same direction). Speeds: 40 & 50 km/hr. Length of faster train = 100 m. Find other train's length.**

**A.**
Relative speed = 10 km/hr = 2.78 m/s
Distance = 10 × 2.78 = 27.8 m → Length = 27.8 – 100 = **–ve (not possible)**
→ Check again, maybe **opposite direction**

---

### **18. A train crosses a man in 20 sec and platform in 35 sec. Platform length = 180 m. Find speed.**

**A.**
Let speed = x m/s
x × 20 = L, x × 35 = L + 180
→ 35x – 20x = 180 → x = 12 m/s → Speed = **43.2 km/hr**

---

### **19. A train crosses a 400 m long platform in 25 seconds at 72 km/hr. Find length of train.**

**A.**
Speed = 20 m/s → Distance = 25×20 = 500
Train = 500 – 400 = **100 m**

---

### **20. Two trains each 120 m long cross each other in 12 sec (opposite). One speed = 36 km/hr. Find other.**

**A.**
Total length = 240 m, Relative speed = 240 / 12 = 20 m/s = 72 km/hr
One speed = 36 → Other = **36 km/hr**

---

### **21. A train 400 m crosses a platform 600 m in 50 sec. Speed?**

**A.**
Total = 1000 m → Speed = 1000/50 = **20 m/s = 72 km/hr**

---

### **22. A train 180 m crosses a man in 9 sec. Speed?**

**A.**
180 / 9 = 20 m/s = **72 km/hr**

---

### **23. A train 300 m takes 30 sec to cross a bridge. Speed = ?**

**A.**
Need bridge length to find total distance.

---

### **24. A 600 m long train crosses a tunnel in 40 seconds. Speed = 54 km/hr. Find length of tunnel.**

**A.**
Speed = 15 m/s → Total distance = 600 + x = 15 × 40 = 600
x = **0 m** (tunnel = 0)

---

###  **25. A train crosses a pole in 9 seconds, platform in 30 seconds. Platform length = 300 m. Find speed.**

**A.**
Let train = L,
L = speed × 9 → platform + L = speed × 30
→ 300 = speed × (30 – 9) = 21 × speed
→ Speed = 300/21 ≈ **14.29 m/s = 51.44 km/hr**
