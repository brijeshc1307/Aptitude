### **3. HCF and LCM**

* **HCF (GCD)**: Highest common factor.
* **LCM**: Least common multiple.

**Relation**:

```
HCF √ó LCM = Product of Two Numbers
```

---

### **4. Remainder Theorem (Shortcuts)**

* **a % b = r** ‚Üí Remainder when **a** is divided by **b**
* **(a √ó b) % c = \[(a % c) √ó (b % c)] % c**
* **(a + b) % c = \[(a % c) + (b % c)] % c**
* **(a - b) % c = \[(a % c) - (b % c)] % c**

**Special Case**:

```
Remainder when 10^n is divided by 9 is always 1.
```

```

---

### **6. Unit Digit Tricks**

**For Powers (a^b):**

* Identify the cyclicity of the unit digit of a.
* Find b mod cycle length.

Example:

```
Unit digit of 7^67
Cycle: 7, 9, 3, 1 ‚Üí length 4
67 % 4 = 3 ‚Üí Third element = 3
Answer: 3
```

### **7. Types of Numbers**

* **Perfect Number**: Sum of its proper divisors equals the number (e.g., 6, 28).
* **Prime Number**: Only divisible by 1 and itself.
* **Co-prime**: Two numbers with HCF = 1.
* **Composite Number**: Not prime; has more than two factors.
