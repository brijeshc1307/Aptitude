## **Key Formulas**

---

### **1. Profit or Loss Calculation**

* **Profit = SP – CP**
* **Loss = CP – SP**

---

### **2. Profit or Loss Percentage**

* **Profit% =** $\frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{CP}} \times 100$
* **Loss% =** $\frac{\text{Loss}}{\text{CP}} \times 100$

---

### **3. Selling Price (SP)**

* **SP = CP × $\left(1 + \frac{\text{Profit%}}{100} \right)$**
* **SP = CP × $\left(1 - \frac{\text{Loss%}}{100} \right)$**

---

### **4. Cost Price (CP)**

* **CP = SP ÷ $\left(1 + \frac{\text{Profit%}}{100} \right)$**
* **CP = SP ÷ $\left(1 - \frac{\text{Loss%}}{100} \right)$**

---

### **5. Marked Price and Discount**

* **Discount = Marked Price – SP**
* **Discount% = $\frac{\text{Discount}}{\text{Marked Price}} \times 100$**
* **SP = MP × $\left(1 - \frac{\text{Discount%}}{100} \right)$**

---

### **6. Successive Discounts**

If two discounts are given: `d1%` and `d2%`, then
**Net Discount% = d1 + d2 – (d1 × d2) / 100**

---

### **7. Profit% When Discount Is Given**

If shopkeeper gives **x% discount** but still makes **y% profit**, then:

* **CP = MP × $\frac{100 - x}{100 + y}$**

---

### **8. If Selling Price of Two Items is Same, One at Gain%, Other at Loss%**

* **Net % Loss =** $\frac{(Gain\% - Loss\%)^2}{200}$

*(Only when SP is same)*

---

### **9. Profit/Loss on Total Transaction**

* If a person sells 2 items at same **SP**, one at **x% gain** and one at **x% loss**,
  then **net loss = x² / 100**

---

### **10. When CP of Two Items is Same, One Sold at x% Profit, Other at x% Loss**

* **Net result = No gain, no loss**

---

### **11. False Weight Formula**

If a trader uses weights **less by x%**, his **gain% = $\frac{x}{100 - x} × 100$**

---

## **Shortcut Tricks**

1. **To quickly find CP or SP**, remember:

   * For profit:
     $\text{CP} = \frac{\text{SP} × 100}{100 + \text{Profit%}}$
     $\text{SP} = \frac{\text{CP} × (100 + \text{Profit%})}{100}$

   * For loss:
     $\text{CP} = \frac{\text{SP} × 100}{100 - \text{Loss%}}$
     $\text{SP} = \frac{\text{CP} × (100 - \text{Loss%})}{100}$

2. **When SP is same & % gain = % loss ⇒ always net loss**
   Use $x^2 / 100$

3. **Use successive discount formula when 2+ discounts are given**

---

### **Example**

**Q.** A man buys an article for ₹100 and sells it for ₹120. Find profit%?
**A.**
Profit = 120 – 100 = ₹20
Profit% = (20 / 100) × 100 = **20%**

---

**Q.** A shopkeeper gives 20% discount on marked price but still gains 25%. Find cost price if MP is ₹500.
**A.**
SP = 500 × (1 – 0.2) = ₹400
CP = 400 / 1.25 = **₹320**

---
---

### **1. An article is bought for ₹250 and sold for ₹300. Find the profit and profit %.**

**Profit =** 300 – 250 = ₹50
**Profit % =** (50 / 250) × 100 = **20%**

---

### **2. An item is bought for ₹400 and sold for ₹320. Find the loss and loss %.**

**Loss =** 400 – 320 = ₹80
**Loss % =** (80 / 400) × 100 = **20%**

---

### **3. Selling price = ₹540, profit = 20%. Find cost price.**

**CP =** 540 / 1.2 = **₹450**

---

### **4. CP = ₹600, loss = 25%. Find SP.**

**SP =** 600 × (1 – 0.25) = **₹450**

---

### **5. SP = ₹880, loss = 20%. Find CP.**

**CP =** 880 / 0.8 = **₹1100**

---

### **6. Find SP to gain 15% on CP ₹200.**

**SP =** 200 × (1 + 0.15) = **₹230**

---

### **7. If a shopkeeper marks an item at ₹1000 and gives a discount of 10%, what is the SP?**

**SP =** 1000 × (1 – 0.10) = **₹900**

---

### **8. An item is sold at 25% profit. If its CP is ₹320, find the SP.**

**SP =** 320 × (1 + 0.25) = **₹400**

---

### **9. A shopkeeper sells an item at 20% loss. CP = ₹500. Find SP.**

**SP =** 500 × 0.8 = **₹400**

---

### **10. If CP = ₹240 and SP = ₹300, find profit %**

**Profit =** ₹60
**Profit % =** (60 / 240) × 100 = **25%**

---

### **11. A trader sold an article at 10% profit. If CP = ₹600, find SP.**

**SP =** 600 × 1.10 = **₹660**

---

### ✅ **12. A product is sold at a loss of 30% and SP is ₹350. Find CP.**

**CP =** 350 / (1 – 0.30) = 350 / 0.7 = **₹500**

---

### ✅ **13. An item marked at ₹1200 is sold at 25% discount. Find SP.**

**SP =** 1200 × 0.75 = **₹900**

---

### ✅ **14. A dealer sells two items for ₹500 each. On one, he gains 20%; on the other, he loses 20%. Find overall profit/loss %.**

**Net Loss =** (20² / 100) = **4% Loss**

---

### ✅ **15. If an article is sold at a gain of 20% instead of a loss of 20%, the SP would be ₹240 more. Find CP.**

**CP =** 240 / (0.20 + 0.20) = 240 / 0.40 = **₹600**

---

### ✅ **16. A man buys a chair at ₹540 and sells it at a loss of 10%. Find the selling price.**

**SP =** 540 × 0.9 = **₹486**

---

### ✅ **17. Find MP if SP = ₹720 after 20% discount.**

**MP =** 720 / 0.80 = **₹900**

---

### ✅ **18. A trader marks his goods 30% above cost and allows 10% discount. Find profit %.**

**Profit % =** (1.3 × 0.9 – 1) × 100 = 17% (approx.)

---

### ✅ **19. A dishonest dealer uses 950 g weight instead of 1 kg and sells at CP. Find profit %.**

**Profit % =** (50 / 950) × 100 = **5.26%**

---

### ✅ **20. A sells a watch to B at 20% profit, B sells it to C at 25% profit. If A bought it at ₹800, find price paid by C.**

B buys = 800 × 1.2 = ₹960
C buys = 960 × 1.25 = **₹1200**

---

### ✅ **21. SP = ₹1120, Profit = 40%, Find CP.**

**CP =** 1120 / 1.40 = **₹800**

---

### ✅ **22. If CP = ₹500 and gain = ₹125, find profit %.**

**Profit % =** (125 / 500) × 100 = **25%**

---

### ✅ **23. An item costs ₹750. Seller wants 20% profit after giving 10% discount. Find MP.**

Let MP = x
SP = x × 0.90 = 750 × 1.20
→ 0.9x = 900 → x = **₹1000**

---

### ✅ **24. CP of 15 articles = SP of 12 articles. Find profit %.**

Profit % = ((15 – 12) / 12) × 100 = **25%**

---

### ✅ **25. A sells a pen to B at 10% loss. B sells to C at 20% gain. If C buys it for ₹132, what was A's cost?**

Let A's cost = x
B buys = x × 0.9
C buys = 0.9x × 1.2 = 1.08x = 132
x = 132 / 1.08 = **₹122.22**
